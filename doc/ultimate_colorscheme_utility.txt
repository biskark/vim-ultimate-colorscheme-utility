==============================================================================
1. Introduction                         *Ultimate-Colorscheme-Utility-Intro* 

|Ultimate-Colorscheme-Utility| is the only tool you'll need for managing your
colorschemes in Vim. Like other colorscheme plugins,
|Ultimate-Colorscheme-Utility| provides key mappings for browsing all your
installed colorschemes. However, |Ultimate-Colorscheme-Utility| also provides
the ability to save favorite colorschemes. You can even have different
favorites for different filetypes!

Additionally, |Ultimate-Colorscheme-Utility| now can manage favorite fonts when
using GVim.

==============================================================================
2. Usage                                *Ultimate-Colorscheme-Utility-Usage* 
By default |Ultimate-Colorscheme-Utility| performs the following actions
automatically (See ||Ultimate-Colorscheme-Utility-Settings|| for more info):
    On Vim Startup:
        1. |Ultimate-Colorscheme-Utility| attempts to load previously saved
           favorites at |&rtp/vim-ultimate-colorscheme-utility/plugin/browser.csv|.
           If it can't find any, it attempts to load a default file at
           |&rtp/vim-ultimate-colorscheme-utility/plugin/default.csv|.
           If that is unsuccessful, |Ultimate-Colorscheme-Utility| complains, so
           don't mess with these files by hand, especially the default file.
        2. |Ultimate-Colorscheme-Utility| creates a list of all installed
           colorschemes and allows for quick, step-by-step browsing of them.
        3. |Ultimate-Colorscheme-Utility| adds key mappings for colorscheme
           browsing, saving favorites schemes to a global favorites list as
           well as a filetype specific list, and for browsing only those
           colorschemes already saved. See |Ultimate-Colorscheme-Utility-Mappings|
           for more info.
        4. If |Ultimate-Colorscheme-Utility| detects that GVim is running, it
           will also load your favorite fonts, or load the default file if none
           are found.
        5. If |Ultimate-Colorscheme-Utility| detects that GVim is running, it
           will then add key mappings for adding and removing favorite fonts,
           cycling through filetype specific fonts, or cycling through
           global fonts. Additionally, a new menu will be added to GVim that
           allows users to use all of |Ultimate-Colorscheme-Utility| without
           using the keymappings. Note that |Ultimate-Colorscheme-Utility| does
           not currently allow for browsing of all available fonts.

    On BufEnter:
        |Ultimate-Colorscheme-Utility| detects whether the current
        colorscheme is in the saved favorites for the current filetype. If it
        is, nothings happens. But, if not, |Ultimate-Colorscheme-Utility| will
        randomnly select a saved colorscheme for the current filetype. If the
        filetype has no saved favorites, |Ultimate-Colorscheme-Utility| checks
        if the current colorscheme is in the saved global favorites and
        performs a similar action. If |Ultimate-Colorscheme-Utility| detects no
        favorites, no action is taken and the colorscheme should be whatever
        it would be by default.
        This same behavior is taken if you are running GVim and have specified
        saving of font favorites.

    On Vim Exit:
        |Ultimate-Colorscheme-Utility| saves the current favorites to
        |&rtp/vim-ultimate-colorscheme-utility/plugin/browser.csv| so you
        never have to worry about manaually saving or loading any of these.
        If you are running GVim and are allowing the saving of favorite fonts,
        |&rtp/vim-ultimate-colorscheme-utility/plugin/font.csv| will be used
        for font specific favorites.


==============================================================================
3. Settings                             *Ultimate-Colorscheme-Utility-Settings* 

|Ultimate-Colorscheme-Utility| defines several global mappings and settings.
See |Ultimate-Colorscheme-Utility-Mappings| or
|Ultimate-Colorscheme-Utility-Settings| for more details on customizing.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Key Mappings                            *Ultimate-Colorscheme-Utility-Mappings*

|Ultimate-Colorscheme-Utility| does not introduce any global functions, only
mappings to those functions. You may set these mappings as you like in your
vimrc file or you can use the default settings listed below.

Example:
>
    let g:ulti_color_Add_Fav = '<F8>'
<

                                                *g:ulti_color_Add_Fav*
g:ulti_color_Add_Fav~
Default: '<leader><leader>a'

Mapping to add current colorscheme to favorite list.
If |g:ulti_color_filetype| is set to 1, adds to a filetype specific list.
If |g:ulti_color_quick_add| is set to 1 as well, also adds to a global list.
If the current colorscheme is already in the filetype specific list, it's
added to the global list regardless of settings.


                                                *g:ulti_color_Remove_Fav*
g:ulti_color_Remove_Fav~
Default: '<leader><leader>A'

Mapping to remove current colorscheme from favorite list.
First checks if it's in a filetype specific list.
If |g:ulti_color_quick_remove| is set to 1, also removes from the global list.
If the current colorscheme is not in the filetype specific list, it's
removed from the global list regardless of settings.


                                                *g:ulti_color_Next_Global*
g:ulti_color_Next_Global~
Default: '<leader><leader>n'

Mapping that sets the colorscheme to the next colorscheme in the global list.


                                                *g:ulti_color_Prev_Global*
g:ulti_color_Prev_Global~
Default: '<leader><leader>N'

Mapping that sets the colorscheme to the previous colorscheme in the global
list.


                                                *g:ulti_color_Next_Fav*
g:ulti_color_Next_Fav~
Default: '<leader><leader>f'

Mapping that sets the colorscheme to the next colorscheme in the favorites
list. If the current filetype has no favorites, uses the global list.


                                                *g:ulti_color_Prev_Fav*
g:ulti_color_Prev_Fav~
Default: '<leader><leader>F'

Mapping that sets the colorscheme to the previous colorscheme in the favorites
list. If the current filetype has no favorites, uses the global list.


                                                *g:ulti_color_Next_Global_Fav*
g:ulti_color_Next_Global_Fav~
Default: '<leader><leader>g'

Mapping that sets the colorscheme to the next colorscheme in the global
favorites list, regardless of the current filetype.
Useful if g:ulti_color_filetype is 1 but you still don't want to worry about
the filetype. For example, if you start setting up favorites for a new
filetype and want to conveniently browse through the current global favorites
and see which ones look good.


                                                *g:ulti_color_Prev_Global_Fav*
g:ulti_color_Prev_Global_Fav~
Default: '<leader><leader>G'

Mapping that sets the colorscheme to the previous colorscheme in the global
favorites list, regardless of the current filetype.
Useful if g:ulti_color_filetype is 1 but you still don't want to worry about
the filetype. For example, if you start setting up favorites for a new
filetype and want to conveniently browse through the current global favorites
and see which ones look good.


                                                *g:ulti_color_See_Fav*
g:ulti_color_See_Fav~
Default: '<leader><leader>q'

Mapping that echoes to the screen a list of all your saved favorites organized
by filetype.


                                                *g:ulti_color_Font_Next_Fav*
g:ulti_color_Font_Next_Fav~
Default: '<leader><leader>e'

Mapping that sets the font to the next font in the favorites
list. If the current filetype has no favorites, uses the global list.


                                                *g:ulti_color_Font_Prev_Fav*
g:ulti_color_Font_Prev_Fav~
Default: '<leader><leader>E'

Mapping that sets the font to the previous font in the favorites
list. If the current filetype has no favorites, uses the global list.


                                                *g:ulti_color_Font_Next_Global_Fav*
g:ulti_color_Font_Next_Global_Fav~
Default: '<leader><leader>r'

Mapping that sets the font to the next font in the global
favorites list, regardless of the current filetype.
Useful if g:ulti_color_filetype is 1 but you still don't want to worry about
the filetype. For example, if you start setting up favorites for a new
filetype and want to conveniently browse through the current global favorites
and see which ones look good.


                                                *g:ulti_color_Font_Prev_Global_Fav*
g:ulti_color_Font_Prev_Global_Fav~
Default: '<leader><leader>R'

Mapping that sets the font to the previous font in the global
favorites list, regardless of the current filetype.
Useful if g:ulti_color_filetype is 1 but you still don't want to worry about
the filetype. For example, if you start setting up favorites for a new
filetype and want to conveniently browse through the current global favorites
and see which ones look good.


                                                *g:ulti_color_Font_Add_Fav*
g:ulti_color_Font_Add_Fav~
Default: '<leader><leader>t'

Mapping to add current font to favorite list.
If |g:ulti_color_filetype| is set to 1, adds to a filetype specific list.
If |g:ulti_color_quick_add| is set to 1 as well, also adds to a global list.
If the current font is already in the filetype specific list, it's
added to the global list regardless of settings.


                                                *g:ulti_color_Font_Remove_Fav*
g:ulti_color_Font_Remove_Fav~
Default: '<leader><leader>T'

Mapping to remove current font from favorite list.
First checks if it's in a filetype specific list.
If |g:ulti_color_quick_remove| is set to 1, also removes from the global list.
If the current font is not in the filetype specific list, it's
removed from the global list regardless of settings.


                                                *g:ulti_color_Write_Fav*
g:ulti_color_Write_Fav~
Default: '<leader><leader>s'

Mapping that writes the favorites list to file.
If |g:ulti_color_auto_save| is set, this is done automatically on exit so
you likely will never use this. However, this may be handy if you have more
than one instance of vim open and want your current changes to favorites to be
available to the other instance. Useful when combined with
|g:ulti_color_Load_Fav|.

    |g:ulti_color_Write_Fav| = '<leader><leader>S'


                                                *g:ulti_color_Load_Fav*
g:ulti_color_Load_Fav~
Default: '<leader><leader>S'

Mapping that loads the favorites list from file.
If |g:ulti_color_auto_load| is set, this is done automatically on startup so
you likely will never use this. However, this may be handy if you have more
than one instance of vim open and change the favorites in the other instance.
Useful when combined with |g:ulti_color_Write_Fav|


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Configuration                           |Ultimate-Colorscheme-Utility-Config|

These settings control the automatic behavior of
|Ultimate-Colorscheme-Utility|. All settings have values of either 0 (for no)
or 1 (for yes). You may overwrite the defaults by using setting them in your
vimrc file.

Example:
>
    let g:ulti_color_verbose = 0
<


                                                   *g:ulti_color_default_keys*
g:ulti_color_default_keys~
Default: 1

If set to 0, any key mappings you don't define in your vimrc file will not be
available at all. Use this if you don't want any extra command available other
than those you explicitly allow.

If set to 1, no worries, your personal key mappings will still trump any
defaults, and only those key mappings you don't specify will be set to
defaults.


                                                   *g:ulti_color_gui_menu*
g:ulti_color_gui_menu~
Default: 1

If set to 1, |Ultimate-Colorscheme-Utility| automatically makes a menu titled
'Favorites' that is tailored to your other configuration choices if you are
running a gui Vim. For example, if you did not want filetype specific
favorites, the Favorites menu will not show those options.

If set to 0, no menu will be made.


                                                   *g:ulti_color_filetype*
g:ulti_color_filetype~
Default: 1

If this is 1, |Ultimate-Colorscheme-Utility| sets filetype specific favorites.

If this to 0, |Ultimate-Colorscheme-Utility| does not concern itself with the
current filetype and only has one list of favorites.
Note: This makes |g:ulti_color_quick_add| and |g:ulti_color_quick_remove|
irrelevant.


                                                   *g:ulti_color_auto_save*
g:ulti_color_auto_save~
Default: 1

If this is 1, your favorites are saved automatically when vim exits.

If this is 0, you must save these manually with the |g:ulti_color_Write_Fav|
mapping.


                                                   *g:ulti_color_auto_load*
g:ulti_color_auto_load~
Default: 1

If this is 1, this setting automatically loads favorites upon Vim start.

If this is 0, you must load these automatically with the |g:ulti_color_Load_Fav|
mapping.


                                                   *g:ulti_color_quick_add*
g:ulti_color_quick_add~
Default: 1

If this is 1, when adding a colorscheme to favorites, the scheme will be saved
to the global favorites list as well as the filetype favorites list.

If this is 0, the scheme will only be added to the global favorites if it's
already in the favorites list for the current filetype.

Note: This setting is irrelevant if |g:ulti_color_filetype| is set to 0.


                                                   *g:ulti_color_quick_remove*
g:ulti_color_quick_remove~
Default: 0

If this is 1, upon removing a colorscheme from favorites, it will be removed
from the global favorites list as well as the filetype favorites list.

If this is 0, the scheme will only be removed from the global favorites if
it's not already in the favorites list for the current filetype. In practice
this means you will have to delete a scheme twice to remove it from the
filetype and global favorites.

Note: This setting is irrelevant if |g:ulti_color_filetype| is set to 0.


                                                   *g:ulti_color_font_enable*
g:ulti_color_font_enable~
Default: 1

If set to 1, |Ultimate-Colorscheme-Utility| will allow the setting of font
favorites in addition to colorscheme favorites. When set, this will add six
key mappings that allow for adding/deleting favorites and for browsing global
and filetype specific fonts.

If set to 0, font favorites will be disabled and if g:ulti_color_gui_menu is
set to 1, there won't be any font related options in the Favorites Menu.

Note: This only matters when using GVim. Terminal vim does not control the font
settings, the terminal does, so if GVim isn't detected, no mappings are
created regardless of this setting.


                                                   *g:ulti_color_verbose*
g:ulti_color_verbose~
Default: 1

If set to 1, this setting will display messages upon the use of most of the
mappings.

If set to 0, only error messages will be displayed.

Note: Some vim installations will not correctly display messages that are only 
1 line long. Sorry!


                                                   *g:ulti_color_always_random*
g:ulti_color_always_random~
Default: 0

If set to 0, upon BufEnter |Ultimate-Colorscheme-Utility| will only change the
colorscheme or font if the newly entered buffer doesn't have the current
colorscheme or font in its list of favorites.

If set to 2, |Ultimate-Colorscheme-Utility| will randomly choose a new
colorscheme when you change between buffers of different filetypes, but not
when changing between buffers of the same filetype. This offers an
intermediate level of randomness when working on differnent filetypes and is
my personal preference.
Note: If you have deactivated filetype specific favorites, this setting will
act the same as setting it to 0.

If set to 1, |Ultimate-Colorscheme-Utility| will randomly choose a
favorite upon every BufEnter regardless of filetype, resulting in a possibly
nauseating change of colors if you have several favorites and frequently switch
between buffers. Use at your own risk!


                                                   *g:ulti_color_excluded*
g:ulti_color_excluded~
Default: ['minibufexpl']

This is a list of filetypes that are to be ignored by
|Ultimate-Colorscheme-Utility| for colorscheme favorites. The utility of this
is when you have |g:ulti_color_filetype| set to 1 but you don't want vim to
recognize one or more particular filetypes for the purpose of favorites. This
is most usefule when |g:ulti_color_always_random| is set to 2, because the
random switch will occur on every filetype change, even if it's to a temporary
buffer created by a vim plugin or help file.

The default has 'minibufexpl' due to a known bug that sometimes causes buffer
change to go through the minibufexpl bar half way through, resulting in
erratic behavior. This can be safely ignored for people who don't use this
plugin.

Example:
>
    let g:ulti_color_excluded = ['minibufexpl', 'nerdtree', 'help', 'tagbar']
<
