Vim Ultimate Colorscheme Utility, version 0.2.1
=======================================

Vim plugin that enables colorscheme and font browsing, choosing favorites, and
automatic/manual scheme switching based on the current filetype. You no longer
have to settle for one favorite scheme or guifont.

New Feature
===========
####Menu Integration

Ultimate Colorscheme Utility is now working on better integration into GVim.
There is now a 'Favorites' menu that enables all the functionality of the
plugin at the push of a button.

Features
========
Ultimate Colorscheme Utility offers several features for customizing your
colorscheme preferences.
- Allows for easy browsing of all installed colorschemes. See the awesome
  archive at https://github.com/flazz/vim-colorschemes for a ton of
  colorschemes.
- Allows saving favorite colorschemes and fonts for all files, or for specific
  filetypes.
- Enables automatic switching of colorschemes and fonts when switching filetype
  buffers so that a favorite is always on.

Required Vim Options
====================
Vim must have been compiled with the following features:
- modify\_fname
- enable-gui (if you want to save your favorite fonts)

Installation
============
Vim-Ultimate-Colorscheme-Utility can also be found at
[vim.org](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=4679), but this
should be avoided as github will always be more up to date.
