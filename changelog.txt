0.2.2 - New Feature
September 5, 2013
	Added the ability to specify a list of excluded filetypes that are not
	treated as special. This means that this will not trigger any filetype
	specific acitities, such as switching the colorscheme when changing into a
	buffer, or allowing the creation of new favorites for that filetype. This
	is most handy for special vim/plugin filetypes, like 'help', 'nerdtree',
	'minibufexp', 'tagbar', etc..., that are opened for more temporary
	purposes.

0.2.1 - New Features, Documentation Upgrade, New Release
September 5, 2013
New Release:
	After branching this project briefly to work on new features, they have
	now been integrated into the master branch. See below for details.

New Features:
	A menu titled "Favorites" is now added to GVim that allows full control of
	your colorscheme browsing and colorscheme/font favorite-ing without
	needing to remember the keymappings. The menu is tailored to your personal
	settings.

	A new state has been added to the g:ulti_color_always_random variable.
	Now, if is set to 2, a random favorite will be chosen when switching
	between buffers of different filetypes, but not when switching between
	buffers of the same filetype. This alleviates an issue where having a
	shared favorite between two filetypes would eventually result in that one
	favorite being the inevitable middle ground when the variable was set to
	0. Note: the default setting is still 0, so the default behavior has not
	changed.

Documentation Upgrade:
	In addition to updating the documentation to reflect the new features, the
	description of the global variables has been updated to hopefully make
	things clearer.

0.2.0a - Bugfix
September 3, 2013
Bug Fixes:
	Fixed bug that failed to turn off new font keymappings when not running
	GVim.

0.2.0 - New Feature, still in Beta
September 3, 2013
New Features:
	Added a favorite fonts list. This will create a separate favorites list,
	both filetype specific and global (just like with the colorschemes), that
	will allow the user to save the current font as a favorite. So far I have
	not included the ability to 'browse' the all fonts the way that you can
	browse the included colorschemes. Note that this feature only works in
	GVim, as terminal vim does not have control of the font settings.

0.1.3 - Minor update
August 19, 2013
Bug Fixes:
	With g:ulti_color_verbose set to 1, there was an issue where sometimes the
	current colorscheme wouldn't be echoed. Added a call to :redraw which
	should fix this.

0.1.2 - Minor update
August 19, 2013
Bug Fixes:
	Fixed bug when manually saving or loading favorites list caused by a typo
	in function name. Thanks to tflo for finding it.

0.1.1 - Minor update
August 7, 2013
New Features:
	Added two new keymappings to allow for the navigation of global
	favorites regardless of setting for g:ulti_color_filetype. Handy when
	settings preferences for a previously unset filetype.

	Documentation updated and slightly reorganized

Bug Fixes:
    Fixed bug that occured when using g:colors_name after manually setting
	background brightness.
