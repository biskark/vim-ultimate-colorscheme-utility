0.2.0 - New Feature, still in Beta
September 3, 2013
New Features:
	Added a favorite fonts list. This will create a separate favorites list,
	both filetype specific and global (just like with the colorschemes), that
	will allow the user to save the current font as a favorite. So far I have
	not included the ability to 'browse' the all fonts the way that you can
	browse the included colorschemes. Note that this feature only works in
	GVim, as terminal vim does not have control of the font settings.

0.1.3 - Minor update
August 19, 2013
Bug Fixes:
	With g:ulti_color_verbose set to 1, there was an issue where sometimes the
	current colorscheme wouldn't be echoed. Added a call to :redraw which
	should fix this.

0.1.2 - Minor update
August 19, 2013
Bug Fixes:
	Fixed bug when manually saving or loading favorites list caused by a typo
	in function name. Thanks to tflo for finding it.

0.1.1 - Minor update
August 7, 2013
New Features:
	Added two new keymappings to allow for the navigation of global
	favorites regardless of setting for g:ulti_color_filetype. Handy when
	settings preferences for a previously unset filetype.

	Documentation updated and slightly reorganized

Bug Fixes:
    Fixed bug that occured when using g:colors_name after manually setting
	background brightness.
